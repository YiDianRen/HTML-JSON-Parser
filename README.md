## Summary :     Html --> Tokens --> JSON
* This program will take an html file and attempt to parse it to a simple JSON file.
* Later, this project will be adapted for a game development project involving a psuedo web browser.
* I also have plans to make a CSS to JSON parser depending on the success of this project.

<!--This is a test to see how well the lexer performs-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<p class="123">
