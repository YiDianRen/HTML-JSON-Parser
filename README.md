# HTML-JSON-Parser

## Summary
This program will take an html file and attempt to parse it to a simple JSON file.
Later, this project will be adapted for a game development project involving a psuedo web browser.
I also have plans to make a CSS to JSON parser depending on the success of this project.


## Input HTML File
``` HTML
<!--This is a test to see how well the lexer performs-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<p class="123">
		This is a simple test
	</p>
</html>
```

## Tokens (Debug only)

## Output JSON File
